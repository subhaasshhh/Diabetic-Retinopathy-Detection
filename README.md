# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection!
The reticence of ocular disorder in the community has been a major deterrent to one being visually impaired before  getting diagnosed. The genesis lies deeper in the inefficiency of  ophthalmologists configuring the root cause of defacement. One  such predicament is Diabetic Retinopathy (caused due to changes  in retinal blood vessels) which is in an upsurge causing  apprehension for vision loss. Meagre research has been carried out  using different learning techniques giving a vague prospect of a  cogent solution. In this paper, we have subsumed potent Deep  Learning (8-Layer CNN) and Transfer Learning architectures  (MobilenetV2, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, ResNet50, VGG16) for  deducing the potentiality of a person having Diabetic Retinopathy  using a 02-Class model with collating varied dataset namely  APTOS 2019 and HRF Image Database begetting pre-eminent  accuracy results with metrics comprehended such as f1 Score,  Area Under Curve, Cohenâ€™s Kappa Score for corroboration.
